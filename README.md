# Three.js-Basic-PWA-Template
This is an ultra basic template / boilerplate for a three.js project that will meet the requirements to be installable as a progressive web app (PWA). It uses Webpack copy to compile everything and to include all the necessary bits and pieces such as icons, manifest.json, and service-worker.js. It is also designed to copy all the required directories and files etc from the src directory and to be easily configurable from the webpack.config.js file.

In Chrome Lighthouse this currently validates against all the PWA requirements.
